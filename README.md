  - Team identity is maintained through consistent color families
  - Data remains clear and readable

## Usage

- Constructor names
- Primary colors from official branding
- Secondary colors (shades of primary)
- Hex color codes
- Additional notes and context

## Notes

- Secondary colors are calculated as 15-20% lighter or darker variations of primary colors
