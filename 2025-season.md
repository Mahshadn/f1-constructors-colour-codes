Notes:
- Primary colors are the main team colors used in official F1 graphics and team branding
- Secondary colors are lighter or darker shades of the primary colors for better team identity while maintaining distinction
- Colors are sourced from official F1 graphics, team livery reveals from the F1 75 Live event in London, and team branding guidelines
- Secondary colors are selected to be approximately 15-20% lighter or darker than the primary colors
- Several teams made significant livery changes for 2025, notably Racing Bulls (formerly RB/Visa Cash App RB) switched to a primarily white livery, Alpine adopted a two-tone pink/blue scheme, and Ferrari introduced more white elements alongside their traditional red
